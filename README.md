## AIDoc
Enhancing healthcare accessibility through AI-driven solutions

## Inspiration
In India, a significant portion of the population struggles with obtaining timely medical consultations due to a shortage of healthcare professionals. This challenge is especially acute in rural areas and among underprivileged communities, where access to medical advice is often delayed or unavailable. The need for efficient, scalable solutions in the healthcare sector is more critical than ever to ensure timely and effective patient care.

Welcome to AIDoc.

## What AIDoc Does
AIDoc is an AI-powered healthcare application designed to provide immediate medical insights to its users. Begin your health consultation by interacting with our AI assistant, which will inquire about your symptoms and identify potential health issues. If necessary, the assistant will guide you to the closest healthcare facility for further treatment. After the interaction, AIDoc saves the conversation and offers actionable health advice that patients can follow before or after visiting a doctor.

For healthcare professionals, AIDoc includes an administrative dashboard that allows for optional patient check-ins to monitor ongoing recovery or health concerns effectively.

## Development of AIDoc
The front end of AIDoc was developed using React, JavaScript, and TailwindCSS, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user interface. The back end was crafted with Python, Flask, and MongoDB, with integration via the Thoughtly AI for seamless communication. We employed Zapier for workflow automation and Google Cloud for data management, ensuring all patient data is securely handled and stored. Our application leverages OpenAI's API to generate personalized health recommendations from user conversations. The entire system is hosted using Heroku for the backend and Netlify for the frontend deployment.

## Challenges Encountered
The integration of various APIs was challenging but ultimately led to a robust application capable of handling real-time user interactions and data processing seamlessly.

## Achievements
We are proud of our seamless integration of complex technologies such as Thoughtly, Zapier, and Google Cloud into a cohesive platform that supports real-time health consultations. We mapped an entire user journey from initial symptom analysis to post-consultation follow-up, ensuring a comprehensive user experience.

## Lessons Learned
The project provided us with invaluable experience in managing a full-stack development project from start to finish within a tight deadline. We gained insights into both the technical and business aspects of creating a healthcare application that can scale.

## Looking Ahead for AIDoc
Future enhancements for AIDoc include migrating our database management to Airtable for improved scalability and incorporating a memory function in our AI to allow for personalized patient care based on past interactions. Our goal is to expand AIDoc's reach nationally and to present our model to incubators and potential investors to further our impact.
